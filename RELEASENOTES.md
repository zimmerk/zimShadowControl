# Changes

## 0.13.1
### Fixes:
* Fix #99: Wrong behavior within lock state 2 (again...)

## 0.13.0
### New features:
* New option `own_logfile_enabled` to write all log output for a Shadow Control instance to a dedicated log file in the Home Assistant configuration directory (`shadow_control_<name>.log`). The file is rotated automatically (max 5 MB, 3 backups). Useful for collecting instance-specific logs over time without filtering the main HA log.

### Fixes:
* Fix #85: B04 ist not allowed to be higher than 5000
* Fix #88: Recursion error with mode3 covers
* Fix #87: Dawn is activated when D01 is deactivated
* Fix #96: Wrong behavior within lock state 2

## 0.12.1
### Fixes:
* Fix accidental exchange of allowed config options for DAWN_OPEN_NOT_BEFORE and DAWN_CLOSE_NOT_LATER_THAN

## 0.12.0
### New features:
* Persist current lock state and restore it after Home Assistant restart
* Fix #8 with new options `dawn_open_not_before_*` and `dawn_close_not_later_than_*`, both as external as well as internal (manual) entity. See [here within README.md](README.md#d11-open-not-before-time) for details.

### Fixes:
* Fix useless creation of angle entities for mode3 covers
* Fix #65, a recursion issue if at least one of the timers was configured to a value of 0. Min value for each timer is 1s now.

## 0.11.1
### Fixes:
* Fix shutter slat angle calculation near the offset borders of shadow range

## 0.11.0
### Breaking changes:
* **Important: If you're using yaml configuration, you must rename the following options within your yaml files before updating to version 0.11.0 or higher!**
  * lock_integration_**static** -> lock_integration_**manual**
  * lock_integration_with_position_**static** -> lock_integration_with_position_**manual**
  * lock_height_**static** -> lock_height_**manual**
  * lock_angle_**static** -> lock_angle_**manual**
  * movement_restriction_height_**static** -> movement_restriction_height_**manual**
  * movement_restriction_angle_**static** -> movement_restriction_angle_**manual**
  * facade_neutral_pos_height_**static** -> facade_neutral_pos_height_**manual**
  * facade_neutral_pos_angle_**static** -> facade_neutral_pos_angle_**manual**
  * All options with **_static** suffix to **_manual** suffix within **shadow** configuration
  * All options with **_static** suffix to **_manual** suffix within **dawn** configuration
* These renamed options are no longer configuration entries within ConfigFlow. They are now dynamically created as `switch`, `number` or `select` entities per **Shadow Control** instance and could be used either right on the instance detail view or directly within own automations. See [README.md](README.md) for naming of these entities.

### New features:
* New additional entity `enforce_positioning_manual` with push button functionality to trigger recalculation and positioning of the shutter.
* New additional entity `unlock_integration_manual` and config option `unlock_integration_entity`, which could be used to unlock the instance.
* New config option `facade_max_movement_duration_static` to configure max movement duration from full closed to full open
* Implement automatic instance lock in case shutters are modified manually
* Activate automatic testing and add a ton of testcases ;-)
* Implement new feature to handle shadow brightness threshold according to summer solstice. To handle this the parameter `shadow_brightness_threshold_*` was renamed to `shadow_brightness_threshold_winter_*` and two new parameters were introduced: `shadow_brightness_threshold_summer_*` and `shadow_brightness_threshold_minimal_*`. Check [Adaptive brightness control](README.md#adaptive-brightness-control) or the readme.md of your UI language for details. Thx to Hardy Köpf (harry7922) for the original implementation within the Edomi-LBS 19001445!
* Update naming of shadow and dawn configuration entries. Now they are streamlined from the configuration through the instance view up to the German and English documentation. Additionally, they use prefixes like "**S01 ...**", "**S02 ...**" ("**B01 ...**", "**B01 ...**" in German) and "**D01 ...**", "**D02 ...**" a.s.o. to define a logical order of **S**hadow and **D**awn configuration entries. This order is used within the ConfigFlow as well as the instance view.
* As Sun integration is already a dependency, use it as default configuration for sun elevation, azimuth, sunrise and sunset.

### Fixes:
* Use HA internal slugify functionality to sanitize instance names
* Fix usage of default values if configuring a new instance via HA UI ConfigFlow.
* Enforcing of shutter positioning works now with configured external entity as well as a corresponding button on the instance view in parallel.
* Movement restriction handling for external entities refactored. The external entities could now use strings according to the used UI translation. Check [Movement restriction height within README.md](README.md#movement-restriction-height) or the readme.md of your UI language for details.
* Fix shutter repositioning after release of lock with position
* Fix initialization after Home Assistant restart
* Fix ignored lock in case lock is active and shutter are modified manually
* Fix calculation of shutter angle (missing projection of slat width to relative azimuth)
* Error handling in case the used yaml configuration contains deprecated configuration keys from previous **Shadow Control** versions.

## 0.10.0
* Bugfix: Fixed position handling if movement is restricted and integration gets unlocked
* Additional sensor values to show computed height and angle in contrast to used height and angle. The values may differ because of movement restrictions or locking.

## 0.9.0
* Bugfix: Fixed position handling if movement is restricted and integration gets unlocked
* Internals: 
  * Automate release creation using GitHub Actions
  * Add full configuration example

## 0.8.0
* Reduce log output during normal operation
* Use local timezone for log statements regarding the next shutter position update
* Shutter mode 3:

  * Disabled some obsolete internal calculations

## 0.7.0
* Improve log dump service to generate c&p ready YAML output

## 0.6.0
* Implement usage of entities to restrict the height and angle movement direction
* Readme finetuning

## 0.5.0
* Add configuration dump service
* Implement new shutter type "Rolling shutter / blind"
* Improve readme files

## 0.4.0
* Allow usage of `input_boolean` as well as `binary_sensor` at 
  * `shadow_control_enabled_entity`
  * `dawn_control_enabled_entity`
  * `lock_integration_entity`
  * `lock_integration_with_position_entity`
  * `enforce_positioning_entity`
* Implement issue [#3 Show states in translated cleartext](https://github.com/starwarsfan/shadow-control/issues/3)
  * A new state sensor for each instance represents the textual value of the current state.
  * The sensor with the numeric state is still available
* Bump ruff from 0.12.1 to 0.12.2

## 0.3.0
